## Problem Set A - Input and Type Conversion
### 1. Temperature Converter 🌡️
    
- Ask the user to enter a temperature in degrees `celsius` ℃.
- Convert the temperature to Fahrenheit using the formula:

    ````
     fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
    ````

- Store the result in a variable `fahrenheit` and print it.

- Remember to use appropriate `# comments` to explain what your code is doing.

### 2. Simple Calculator 🧮

- Create a program that takes two numbers ``num1`` and ``num2`` from the user.
- Ask which operation they want to perform _**addition, subtraction, multiplication,**_ or **_division_**.
- Based on their input, perform the corresponding operation and print the result.

num1 = 
num2 = 

addition_result = 

print("Division Result = ")

````
  
</details>

- Remember to use appropriate `# comments` to explain what your code is doing.

## Problem Set B - Boolean and Logical Operators 
### 3. Vowel Checker

- Write a program that asks the user for a single letter and checks if it is a vowel **(a, e, i, o, u)**. 
- Print `True` if it is, otherwise print `False`.

### 4. Eligibility Check 🪪

- Ask the user for their ``age`` and whether they are a student (``True`` or ``False``).
- If the user is ``18`` or older and a student, print **"You qualify for the discount!"**
- Otherwise, print **"You do not qualify."**

## Problem Set C - Combining Concepts
### 5. Tip Calculator 💵

- Write a program that asks for the ``total bill`` amount and the ``tip percentage`` as a number **(e.g., 10 for 10%)**.
- Calculate the ``total amount`` including the tip.
- Then print the result in a _formatted string_ like **"The total bill, including a 10% tip, is $110."**

### 6. Grade Checker 📝
    
- Create a program that takes a score (0-100) from the user and prints out the corresponding grade:
````
90-100: A
80-89: B
70-79: C
60-69: D
Below 60: F
````

## Problem Set D - Advanced If-Else and Comparison Logic
7. **Number Range**
    - Ask the user for a number, and print:
      - "The number is positive" if it's greater than 0.
      - "The number is negative" if it's less than 0.
      - "The number is zero" if it's equal to 0.

8. **Password Validator**
    - Write a program that checks if the user's entered password is the same as a predefined password (stored in the code). If it matches, print "Access granted," otherwise print "Access denied."
