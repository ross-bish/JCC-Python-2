These problem sets should help you to reinforce fundamental concepts we learned last year and are good way to warm up your Python skills after summer break!


# Challenges ⚔️
Here’s a set of 10 beginner-level Python problems sets:

### Problem Set 1: Print Statements
1. **Hello World!**
   - Write a program that prints the text: `Hello, World!`
   
2. **Introduction**
   - Create a program that prints a sentence introducing yourself. Include your name, age, and favorite hobby using multiple `print` statements.
````
My name is Gandalf.
I am 55,000 years old.
I enjoy magic.
````

### Problem Set 2: Variables and Assignment
3. **Basic Variable Assignment**
   - Declare a variable `name` and assign it your name.
   - Declare a variable `age` and assign it your age.
   - Print the values of both variables.

4. **Swapping Variables**
   - Assign the value of `10` to a variable `a`, and the value of `5` to a variable `b`.
   - Swap the values of `a` and `b` and print the new values of both.

### Problem Set 3: String Concatenation
5. **Concatenation of Strings and Variables**
   - Create a program that stores your name and your favorite food in two variables. Print a sentence combining the two, such as "My name is John and I love pizza."

6. **Greeting Message**
   - Write a program that asks the user to input their name, then prints a personalized greeting, such as: "Hello, Sarah! Welcome back!"

### Problem Set 4: Boolean Comparisons
7. **Simple Boolean Comparisons**
   - Write a program that compares two numbers (e.g., `5 > 3`), and prints whether the comparison is `True` or `False`.

8. **Equality Check**
   - Create a program that takes two user inputs (numbers) and checks if they are equal. Print `True` if they are, otherwise print `False`.

### Problem Set 5: Basic Arithmetic
9. **Basic Math Operations**
   - Write a program that performs the following operations and prints the result: 
     - Sum of 10 and 5.
     - Subtraction of 8 from 20.
     - Multiplication of 6 by 7.
     - Division of 20 by 4.

10. **Calculate the Area of a Rectangle**
    - Write a program that takes the width and height of a rectangle as input from the user, then calculates and prints the area.

## Extra Credit: If-Else Conditions ✨
11. **Even or Odd**
    - Write a program that asks the user for a number, then prints whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
